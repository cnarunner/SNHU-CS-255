# SNHU-CS-255


## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass client wanted a learning environment that provides teaching in preparation for the DMV test. They wanted a learning environment with courses, practice tests and the ability to schedule real-life driving with an instructor. In the DriverPass project we were outlining and designing the reqirements needed/requested from the DriverPass client. They wanted a few different packages for their system, with the option to add more or change them in the future. 

## What did you do particularly well?
I was particularly proud of the diagrams I created for the second project. I believe they came out nice-looking and organized while capturing everything that was needed.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
In the Project One short paper, I missed a question in one of the sections. In the same document I didn't make it to the Object Model Application or Process and Object Model Comparison areas of the paper. If I were able to go back and do it, I would complete these sections.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The DriverPass client wanted to be able to access their data from wherever to download reports. The easiest solution I saw to this was to make this a web-based platform. It is very important to meet the user's needs when designing a product, because without certain functionality the application becomes useless. If it isn't pleasant and easy to use, the user will just find a different solution instead of using the product that I created. 

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I liked all of the diagrams that we created for this class. They made it easy to see what was happening or what needed to be done. If I were working with a team I think taking the time to create all of the diagrams makes sense, however, on a solo project I think just keeping it simple is the better option. On a solo project I would probably limit to use cases (not the diagram) and a UML class diagram to better understand the best way to approach actually writing the software.
